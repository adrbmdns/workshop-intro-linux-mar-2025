# Step 1 - Install a Linux system

## Windows user to download WSL (windows subsystem for Linux)

Follow this [Microsoft tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to install WSL on your Windows operating system. Choose Ubuntu as the Linux distribution to dowanload and install. 

__WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)__ is a compatibility layer that allows you to run a Linux environment directly on Windows without the need for a virtual machine or dual-boot setup. It enables users to execute Linux commands, run Linux applications, and use Linux tools alongside Windows programs. 

Since we are learning how to use the Linux system in this workshop, so it's necessary for us to have a Linux system ready on our device. That's why we are installing WSL. 

Once you have successfully installed the Ubuntu WSL, you can open the Ubuntu App to use it everytime.

## Mac user

MacOS user don't need to install a Linux system because MacOS is a Unix-based system. It is built on a Unix foundation, and it supports a command-line interface (Terminal) similar to Linux. So the basic commands we are learning for Linux can be run on MacOS as well.

Open Terminal to use it.
